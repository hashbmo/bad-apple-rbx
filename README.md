# bad apple rbx

- Made this project because I'd always been interested in learning how other people did it
- The method used to load the frame data probably isn't the best but oh well

### Getting setup

- Load server.py into your IDE of choice
- If you have the appropriate modules preinstalled, skip to the next step, otherwise create a new virtual environment and install and the required modules using pip
- Run server.py [console should output: "server running"] if everything is working correctly
- Open roblox game file and click play

### Notes

- Like my previous project, this only works locally but I'm considering making it web based
